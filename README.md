--- Color generator ---

------

In this project, you can generate random colors. The chroma.js library is used to generate colors and determine the hue. When you click on the "lock" icon, the color stops changing. You can save your favorite colors to the clipboard or send to friends via a link. The project is made for desktop. Colors are changed by pressing the space bar.
